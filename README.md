# Skin Cancer Detection Prototype

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](LICENSE)

## Overview

This repository provides a prototype for detecting skin cancer using state-of-the-art machine learning and computer vision techniques in Python. The goal is to assist in the early detection of skin cancer through automated image analysis.

## Features

- Image preprocessing and augmentation
- Model training and evaluation
- Prediction on new images
- Visualization and reporting tools

## Tech Stack

- Python (99.8%)
- Batchfile (0.2%)
- Libraries: TensorFlow / PyTorch, NumPy, pandas, OpenCV, scikit-learn, Matplotlib

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- pip (Python package manager)
- (Optionally) An NVIDIA GPU for faster training

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sakshi22sk/Cancer_detection_dermatologists.git
   cd Cancer_detection_dermatologists
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

1. Prepare your dataset and place images in the appropriate folders (see documentation or code comments).
2. Train the model:
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```
3. Run predictions on new images:
   ```bash
   python predict.py --image path/to/your/image.jpg
   python predict.py --image path/to/your/image1.jpg
   ```
